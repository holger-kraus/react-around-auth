# Across the U.S. - React version

## Web Development course at Yandex Practicum
I am participating in an excellent web development course at [Yandex Practicum](https://practicum.yandex.com/) right now.
You get a very good introduction into many web development topics on their learning platform. After mastering the
according lessons, you have to proof your newly acquired skills in your own projects.

## My fourth project
This is my first project that I have implemented as part of the course. The main focus is to migrate the existing
"Across the U.S." project, that was just plain HTML, CSS and Javascript to React.

### Functionality

The website is a profile page. It contains a set of photographies that can be liked by users. The page also contains
an edit functionality where the user can change the name and the about me information. The edit form pops up in a modal
dialogue. Furthermore, the user can add further images by providing their URIs. He also can remove images again from the
photo grid. If he clicks on one of the photo cards, the photo enlarges and is displayed as the main element on the
screen.

### Technologies

In detail the following technologies and methods have been used:
* Semantic HTML like
    * sections
    * header
    * footer
    * main area
    * headlines
    * paragraphs
    * lists
    * links
* BEM Methodology (Block, Element, Modifier)
    * How to organize CSS сlasses
    * How to organize CSS files
* CSS techniques like
    * box model
    * flexbox
    * positioning
    * media queries
* Javascript
    * React components
    * React hooks

 ### Have a look!

The page is installed on Github Pages [here](https://holger-kraus.github.io/around-react/).

### How to run it

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

##### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

##### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

##### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

##### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
